# Product Brief: zk-bank

**Date:** 2025-11-26
**Author:** AbuUsama
**Context:** Developer/Power User Tool

## Executive Summary

zk-bank is a CLI-based social trading application for a CDP (Collateralized Debt Position) protocol. The core innovation: **a terminal chat interface where trading, social interaction, and AI agents converge** - nothing like this exists in crypto or elsewhere.

Users trade via natural language in a trollbox, watch liquidations happen in real-time, and interact with a mix of humans and AI agents (indistinguishable by design). The CLI-first approach creates a hackable, developer-friendly client that can later inform web UI development.
