# zk-bank - Epic Breakdown

**Date:** 2025-11-27
**Project Level:** Quick-Flow (Enterprise slice)

## Epic 1: Foundation Infrastructure

**Slug:** foundation-infra

### Goal

Establish the architectural foundation that enables all subsequent features by removing dual-mode complexity, implementing centralized state management, setting up real-time backend infrastructure, and creating the core UI shell with theming support.

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Remove Commander.js and dual-mode CLI logic
- Install and configure Jotai for atomic state management
- Install and configure Convex backend infrastructure
- Implement theme system with 5 selectable themes
- Create AppShell layout (Banner, Footer, TabNav)
- Create placeholder pages (Dashboard, Trollbox, Chain)
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Local config persistence

**Out of Scope:**
- Page content implementation
- Convex functions beyond schema
- Groq/LLM integration
- Cast CDP operations
- Onboarding flow
- Trade-from-chat functionality

### Success Criteria

1. CLI launches directly into Ink app (no Commander mode)
2. State persists across CLI restarts (theme, layout mode)
3. Convex dev server connects successfully
4. All 5 themes render correctly with semantic colors
5. Tab navigation (1, 2, 3 keys) switches pages
6. AppShell displays Banner at top, Footer at bottom

### Dependencies

- Bun 1.0+ (existing)
- Ink 5.1.0 (existing)
- React 19.2.0 (existing)
- Foundry/cast (existing - for future stories)

## Implementation Timeline - Epic 1

**Total Story Points:** 13

**Implementation Sequence:**

| Order | Story | Points | Can Start After |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Story 1.1: Remove Commander | 2 | - |
| 1 | Story 1.3: Add Convex | 2 | - (parallel) |
| 2 | Story 1.2: Add Jotai | 3 | Story 1.1 |
| 3 | Story 1.4: Theme System | 3 | Story 1.2 |
