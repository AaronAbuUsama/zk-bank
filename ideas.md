# LUSD v2 Ideas

## Cleaned Raw Log
This is essentially a LUSD v2, what it should have been. LUSD v1 was great. It was a fantastic protocol. You had no interest. It's usury free. All these other protocols have some sort of interest element. Why are we replicating that? It's not even necessary. You're printing money at zero cost. So why charge interest? This is v2, we keep the interest free. We also add multi collateral. All these protocols under the hood have a communication problem. Technology is so powerful. It's a superpower. We can do things now with money that were unimaginable. Use similar financial instruments that the rich use to stay rich. How did the rich get rich? They don't sell assets. They borrow against them. As assets appreciate, their debt shrinks against the value. They keep refinancing and never sell. That's how you build generational wealth. This is access to everybody now with crypto assets. The dollar is being inflated into oblivion. We still need to use the dollar every day. How do we get around that? This is how we escape the matrix. The bank protocol changes the relationship you have with your money. It's not about unbanking or banking the unbanked. It enables you to be your own bank. You are a bank. You put your assets in and mint currency backing your assets. You use that currency to make more assets to bank against. That's what it's about. We include governance as a feature. This is not individualistic. Collectively, users participate in a monetary system. People choose with their feet where to transact. People care about dollar denomination for pricing, but don't want to hold dollars. The dollar supply is growing exponentially. There's a push from the US into stable coins to push inflation onto the world. USDC, USDT have trust me bro reserves. It's a ticking time bomb. We'll get rugged. If there's a systematic crash and the dollar loses value, we need protection. This protocol protects us. It's open source. You can deploy your own instance. We provide tools to deploy your own instance. You're building your own private economy. We enable people to build private economies with their own parameters. You don't have to peg to the dollar. You can peg to anything with a consistent price. It can be a basket of currencies, gold, anything.

LUSD v2 builds on the success of LUSD v1, a fantastic protocol that offered interest-free borrowing. Unlike other protocols that incorporate interest elements—despite printing money at zero cost—this version maintains its usury-free nature while adding multi-collateral support. Underlying these protocols is a communication challenge: technology has become a superpower, enabling unprecedented financial innovations that mirror the strategies of the wealthy. The rich accumulate wealth not by selling assets, but by borrowing against them. As assets appreciate and debt's value diminishes relative to asset growth, they refinance repeatedly, preserving generational wealth. Now, with crypto assets, this access is available to everyone.

The dollar is being inflated into oblivion, yet remains essential for daily use. To escape this matrix of inflation, the bank protocol fundamentally alters one's relationship with money. It's not about unbanking or banking the unbanked; instead, it empowers users to become their own banks. By depositing assets, users mint currency backed by those assets, which can then be used to acquire more assets for further borrowing. This creates a cycle of wealth building.

Governance is integrated as a key feature, transforming the protocol from an individualistic tool into a collective monetary system. Users participate in stablecoins they collectively mint, provide liquidity for, and transact with, choosing systems with their feet. While dollar denomination matters for pricing, no one wants to hold actual dollars. The dollar supply is growing exponentially, with a US-driven push toward stablecoins like USDC and USDT—backed by "trust me bro" reserves—that risks global inflation exposure and potential rug pulls.

In the event of a systematic crash where the dollar loses significant value, this protocol offers protection. As a truly open-source project, it allows users to deploy their own instances without forking, enabling the creation of private economies with customizable parameters. Pegging isn't limited to the dollar; it can target any consistently priced asset, such as a basket of currencies or gold.
